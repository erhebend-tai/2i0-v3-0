Turns out that despite\nall the review on the locking, we missed completely that the\nlogic is wrong: if the refcount hits zero we can finish (and\nneed not wait for the completion), but if it doesn't we have\nto trigger all the cancellations. As written, we can _never_\nget into the loop triggering the cancellations. Fix this, and\nexplain it better while at it.",
