However, during unregistration, the code only removes the\nnode from the hashtable without freeing the associated memory, resulting\nin a memory leak.\n\nResolve the memory leak issue by ensuring the allocated notifier callback\nnode is properly freed after it is removed from the hashtable entry.",
