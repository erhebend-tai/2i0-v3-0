  ],
  "details": "Multiple out-of-bounds read and write vulnerabilities exist in the ControlVault WBDI Driver Broadcom Storage Adapter functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.14.19 and Dell ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.36.47. A specially crafted WinBioControlUnit call can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can issue an api call to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability is triggered when submitting a `WinBioControlUnit` call to the StorageAdapter with the ControlCode 2 (`WBIO_USH_GET_IDENTITY`)  with  `4 <= ReceiveBuferSize < 80`  This will lead to an out-of-bound write of up to 75 bytes. These can be either null-bytes or potentially attacker controlled data if another vulnerability is leveraged to place attacked-controlled data as Identity inside the database.",
