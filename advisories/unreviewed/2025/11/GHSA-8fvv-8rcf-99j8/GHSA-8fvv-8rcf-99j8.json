  "details": "The Looker endpoint for generating new projects from database connections allows users to specify \"looker\" as a connection name, which is a reserved internal name for Looker's internal MySQL database. The schemas parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection, enabling attackers to manipulate SELECT queries that are constructed and executed against the internal MySQL database. This vulnerability allows users with developer permissions to extract data from Looker's internal MySQL database.\n\nLooker-hosted and Self-hosted were found to be vulnerable.\nThis issue has already been mitigated for Looker-hosted instances. No user action is required for these.\n\n\nSelf-hosted instances must be upgraded as soon as possible. This vulnerability has been patched in all supported versions of Self-hosted.\nThe versions below have all been updated to protect against this vulnerability. You can download these versions at the Looker download page  https://download.looker.com/ :\n  *  24.12.106\n  *  24.18.198+\n  *  25.0.75\n  *  25.6.63+\n  *  25.8.45+\n  *  25.10.33+\n  *  25.12.1+\n  *  25.14+",
