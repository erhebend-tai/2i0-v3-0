  "details": "An authenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in Cloudlog 2.7.5 and earlier. The vucc_details_ajax function in application/controllers/Awards.php does not properly sanitize the user-supplied Gridsquare POST parameter. This allows a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting a malicious payload, which is then concatenated directly into a raw SQL query in the vucc_qso_details function.",
