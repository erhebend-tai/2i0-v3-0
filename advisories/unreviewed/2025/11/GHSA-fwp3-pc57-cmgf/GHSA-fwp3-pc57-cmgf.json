  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: pm80xx: Fix array-index-out-of-of-bounds on rmmod\n\nSince commit f7b705c238d1 (\"scsi: pm80xx: Set phy_attached to zero when\ndevice is gone\") UBSAN reports:\n\n  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/scsi/pm8001/pm8001_sas.c:786:17\n  index 28 is out of range for type 'pm8001_phy [16]'\n\non rmmod when using an expander.\n\nFor a direct attached device, attached_phy contains the local phy id.\nFor a device behind an expander, attached_phy contains the remote phy\nid, not the local phy id.\n\nI.e. while pm8001_ha will have pm8001_ha->chip->n_phy local phys, for a\ndevice behind an expander, attached_phy can be much larger than\npm8001_ha->chip->n_phy (depending on the amount of phys of the\nexpander).\n\nE.g. on my system pm8001_ha has 8 phys with phy ids 0-7.  One of the\nports has an expander connected.  The expander has 31 phys with phy ids\n0-30.\n\nThe pm8001_ha->phy array only contains the phys of the HBA.  It does not\ncontain the phys of the expander.  Thus, it is wrong to use attached_phy\nto index the pm8001_ha->phy array for a device behind an expander.\n\nThus, we can only clear phy_attached for devices that are directly\nattached.",
