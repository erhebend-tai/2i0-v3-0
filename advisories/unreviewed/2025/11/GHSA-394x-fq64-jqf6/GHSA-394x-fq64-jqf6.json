  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: hi311x: fix null pointer dereference when resuming from sleep before interface was enabled\n\nThis issue is similar to the vulnerability in the `mcp251x` driver,\nwhich was fixed in commit 03c427147b2d (\"can: mcp251x: fix resume from\nsleep before interface was brought up\").\n\nIn the `hi311x` driver, when the device resumes from sleep, the driver\nschedules `priv->restart_work`. However, if the network interface was\nnot previously enabled, the `priv->wq` (workqueue) is not allocated and\ninitialized, leading to a null pointer dereference.\n\nTo fix this, we move the allocation and initialization of the workqueue\nfrom the `hi3110_open` function to the `hi3110_can_probe` function.\nThis ensures that the workqueue is properly initialized before it is\nused during device resume. And added logic to destroy the workqueue\nin the error handling paths of `hi3110_can_probe` and in the\n`hi3110_can_remove` function to prevent resource leaks.",
