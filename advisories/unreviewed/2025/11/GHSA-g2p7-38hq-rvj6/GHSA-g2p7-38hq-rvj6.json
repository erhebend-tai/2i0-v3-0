  "details": "In Apache CloudStack, a gap in access control checks affected the APIs - createNetworkACL\n- listNetworkACLs\n- listResourceDetails\n- listVirtualMachinesUsageHistory\n- listVolumesUsageHistory\n\nWhile these APIs were accessible only to authorized users, insufficient permission validation meant that users could occasionally access information beyond their intended scope.\n\n\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.20.2.0 or 4.22.0.0, which fixes the issue.",
