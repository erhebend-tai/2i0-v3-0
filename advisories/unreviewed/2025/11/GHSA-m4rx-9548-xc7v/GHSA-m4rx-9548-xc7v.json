  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Fix peer lookup in ath12k_dp_mon_rx_deliver_msdu()\n\nIn ath12k_dp_mon_rx_deliver_msdu(), peer lookup fails because\nrxcb->peer_id is not updated with a valid value. This is expected\nin monitor mode, where RX frames bypass the regular RX\ndescriptor path that typically sets rxcb->peer_id.\nAs a result, the peer is NULL, and link_id and link_valid fields\nin the RX status are not populated. This leads to a WARN_ON in\nmac80211 when it receives data frame from an associated station\nwith invalid link_id.\n\nFix this potential issue by using ppduinfo->peer_id, which holds\nthe correct peer id for the received frame. This ensures that the\npeer is correctly found and the associated link metadata is updated\naccordingly.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.4.1-00199-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1",
