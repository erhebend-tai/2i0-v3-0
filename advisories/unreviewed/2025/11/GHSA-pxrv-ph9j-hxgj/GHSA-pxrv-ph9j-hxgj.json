  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmailbox: zynqmp-ipi: Fix SGI cleanup on unbind\n\nThe driver incorrectly determines SGI vs SPI interrupts by checking IRQ\nnumber < 16, which fails with dynamic IRQ allocation. During unbind,\nthis causes improper SGI cleanup leading to kernel crash.\n\nAdd explicit irq_type field to pdata for reliable identification of SGI\ninterrupts (type-2) and only clean up SGI resources when appropriate.",
