  ],
  "details": "The WP Import – Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 7.33.1. This is due to deserialization of untrusted data supplied via CSV file imports in the import_single_post_as_csv function within SingleImportExport.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access or higher, to inject a PHP object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
