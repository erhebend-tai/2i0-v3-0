  ],
  "details": "Multiple out-of-bounds read and write vulnerabilities exist in the ControlVault WBDI Driver Broadcom Storage Adapter functionality of Dell ControlVault3 prior to 5.15.14.19 and Dell ControlVault3 Plus prior to 6.2.36.47. A specially crafted WinBioControlUnit call can lead to memory corruption. An attacker can issue an api call to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability is triggered when submitting a `WinBioControlUnit` call to the StorageAdapter with the ControlCode 4 (`WBIO_USH_ADD_RECORD`) and with  `0 < SendBufferSize < 104`. A various amount of bytes can be read ouf of bound past the end the `SendBuffer`. The constraints surrounding this exploitation are pretty tough and may make the exploitation of this vulnerability less likely or limited to a Denial of Services.",
