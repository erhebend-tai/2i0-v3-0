  ],
  "details": "A heap corruption vulnerability exists in the Advantech TP-3250 printer driver's DrvUI_x64_ADVANTECH.dll (v0.3.9200.20789) when DocumentPropertiesW() is called with a valid dmDriverExtra value but an undersized output buffer. The driver incorrectly assumes the output buffer size matches the input buffer size, leading to invalid memory operations and heap corruption. This vulnerability can cause denial of service through application crashes and potentially lead to code execution in user space. Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
