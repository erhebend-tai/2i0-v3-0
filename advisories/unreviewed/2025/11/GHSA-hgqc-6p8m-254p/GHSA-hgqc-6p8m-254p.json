  "details": "The Live Photos on WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'video_src', 'img_src', and 'class' parameters in the livephotos_photo shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute when a user accesses an injected page.",
