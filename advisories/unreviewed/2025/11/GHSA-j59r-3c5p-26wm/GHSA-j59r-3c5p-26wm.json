  ],
  "details": "The Zegen Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the '/custom-font-code/custom-fonts-uploads.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
