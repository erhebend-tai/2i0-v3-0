  "details": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, achievable through an XML External Entity (XXE) injection, exists in MetInfo Content Management System (CMS) thru 8.1. This flaw stems from a defect in the XML parsing logic, which allows an attacker to construct a malicious XML entity that forces the server to initiate an HTTP request to an arbitrary internal or external network address. Successful exploitation could lead to internal network reconnaissance, port scanning, or the retrieval of sensitive information. The vulnerability may be present in the backend API called by or associated with the path `/admin/#/webset/?head_tab_active=0`, where user-provided XML data is processed.",
