  ],
  "details": "The Pagerank Tools plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.5. This is due to missing nonce validation on the pr_save_settings() function and insufficient input sanitization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the plugin's settings page.",
