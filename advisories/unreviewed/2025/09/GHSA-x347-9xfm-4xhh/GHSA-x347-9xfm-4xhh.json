  "details": "An issue was discovered in rust-ffmpeg 0.3.0 (after comit 5ac0527) A use-after-free vulnerability in the write_interleaved method allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or memory corruption. The method violates Rust's aliasing rules by modifying a data structure through a mutable pointer while only holding an immutable reference, which can lead to undefined behavior when the data is accessed later.",
