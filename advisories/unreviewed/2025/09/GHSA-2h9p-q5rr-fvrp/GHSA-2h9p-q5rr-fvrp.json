  "details": "An authenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to improper input validation in the event processor admin service. A user with administrative access to the SOAP admin services can exploit this flaw by deploying a Siddhi execution plan containing malicious Java code, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the server.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability requires a valid user account with administrative privileges, limiting the attack surface to authenticated but potentially malicious users.",
