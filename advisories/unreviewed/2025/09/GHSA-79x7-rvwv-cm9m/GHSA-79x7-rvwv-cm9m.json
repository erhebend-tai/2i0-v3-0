  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: hci_event: Ignore multiple conn complete events\n\nWhen one of the three connection complete events is received multiple\ntimes for the same handle, the device is registered multiple times which\nleads to memory corruptions. Therefore, consequent events for a single\nconnection are ignored.\n\nThe conn->state can hold different values, therefore HCI_CONN_HANDLE_UNSET\nis introduced to identify new connections. To make sure the events do not\ncontain this or another invalid handle HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX and checks\nare introduced.\n\nBuglink: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215497",
