  "details": "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings could have allowed an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a targeted Webex Meetings user to an untrusted website. Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.\n\n This vulnerability existed because of insufficient validation of URLs that were included in a meeting-join URL. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by including a URL to a website of their choosing in a specific value of a Cisco Webex Meetings join URL. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to redirect a targeted user to a website that was controlled by the attacker, possibly making the user more likely to believe the website was trusted by Webex and perform additional actions as part of phishing attacks.",
