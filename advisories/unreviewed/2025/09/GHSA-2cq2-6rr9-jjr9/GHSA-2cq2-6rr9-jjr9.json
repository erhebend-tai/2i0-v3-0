  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda: tas2781: Fix wrong reference of tasdevice_priv\n\nDuring the conversion to unify the calibration data management, the\nreference to tasdevice_priv was wrongly set to h->hda_priv instead of\nh->priv.  This resulted in memory corruption and crashes eventually.\nUnfortunately it's a void pointer, hence the compiler couldn't know\nthat it's wrong.",
