An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a valid request to a specific API endpoint within the affected system. A successful exploit could allow a low-privileged user to view sensitive configuration information on the affected system that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access as a low-privileged user.&nbsp;&nbsp;",
