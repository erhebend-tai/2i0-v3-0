  "details": "The Meks Easy Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the post title field in all version up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the map containing the malicious post.",
