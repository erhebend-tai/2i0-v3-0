  "details": "The Simple Registration for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.8. This is due to missing nonce validation on the role requests admin page handler in the includes/display-role-admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to approve pending role requests and escalate user privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
