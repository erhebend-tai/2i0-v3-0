  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: f_hid: fix f_hidg lifetime vs cdev\n\nThe embedded struct cdev does not have its lifetime correctly tied to\nthe enclosing struct f_hidg, so there is a use-after-free if /dev/hidgN\nis held open while the gadget is deleted.\n\nThis can readily be replicated with libusbgx's example programs (for\nconciseness - operating directly via configfs is equivalent):\n\n\tgadget-hid\n\texec 3<> /dev/hidg0\n\tgadget-vid-pid-remove\n\texec 3<&-\n\nPull the existing device up in to struct f_hidg and make use of the\ncdev_device_{add,del}() helpers.  This changes the lifetime of the\ndevice object to match struct f_hidg, but note that it is still added\nand deleted at the same time.",
