  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-mq: fix blk_mq_tags double free while nr_requests grown\n\nIn the case user trigger tags grow by queue sysfs attribute nr_requests,\nhctx->sched_tags will be freed directly and replaced with a new\nallocated tags, see blk_mq_tag_update_depth().\n\nThe problem is that hctx->sched_tags is from elevator->et->tags, while\net->tags is still the freed tags, hence later elevator exit will try to\nfree the tags again, causing kernel panic.\n\nFix this problem by replacing et->tags with new allocated tags as well.\n\nNoted there are still some long term problems that will require some\nrefactor to be fixed thoroughly[1].\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250815080216.410665-1-yukuai1@huaweicloud.com/",
