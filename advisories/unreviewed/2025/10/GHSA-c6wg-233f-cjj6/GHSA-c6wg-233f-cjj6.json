An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, the phone must be registered to Cisco Unified Communications Manager and have Web Access enabled. Web Access is disabled by default.",
