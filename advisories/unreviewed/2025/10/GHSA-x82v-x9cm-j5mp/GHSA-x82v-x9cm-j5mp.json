  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthunderbolt: Fix use-after-free in tb_dp_dprx_work\n\nThe original code relies on cancel_delayed_work() in tb_dp_dprx_stop(),\nwhich does not ensure that the delayed work item tunnel->dprx_work has\nfully completed if it was already running. This leads to use-after-free\nscenarios where tb_tunnel is deallocated by tb_tunnel_put(), while\ntunnel->dprx_work remains active and attempts to dereference tb_tunnel\nin tb_dp_dprx_work().\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0                            | CPU 1\ntb_dp_tunnel_active()            |\n  tb_deactivate_and_free_tunnel()| tb_dp_dprx_start()\n    tb_tunnel_deactivate()       |   queue_delayed_work()\n      tb_dp_activate()           |\n        tb_dp_dprx_stop()        | tb_dp_dprx_work() //delayed worker\n          cancel_delayed_work()  |\n    tb_tunnel_put(tunnel);       |\n                                 |   tunnel = container_of(...); //UAF\n                                 |   tunnel-> //UAF\n\nReplacing cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() is\nnot feasible as it would introduce a deadlock: both tb_dp_dprx_work()\nand the cleanup path acquire tb->lock, and cancel_delayed_work_sync()\nwould wait indefinitely for the work item that cannot proceed.\n\nInstead, implement proper reference counting:\n- If cancel_delayed_work() returns true (work is pending), we release\n  the reference in the stop function.\n- If it returns false (work is executing or already completed), the\n  reference is released in delayed work function itself.\n\nThis ensures the tb_tunnel remains valid during work item execution\nwhile preventing memory leaks.\n\nThis bug was found by static analysis.",
