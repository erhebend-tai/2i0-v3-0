  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregulator: core: Prevent integer underflow\n\nBy using a ratio of delay to poll_enabled_time that is not integer\ntime_remaining underflows and does not exit the loop as expected.\nAs delay could be derived from DT and poll_enabled_time is defined\nin the driver this can easily happen.\n\nUse a signed iterator to make sure that the loop exits once\nthe remaining time is negative.",
