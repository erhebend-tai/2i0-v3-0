  ],
  "details": "The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.46. This is due to the plugin exposing state-changing REST actions through an AJAX bridge without proper CSRF token validation, and having destructive logic reachable via GET requests with no permission_callback. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to force logged-in administrators to create, update, or delete markers and geometry features via CSRF attacks, and allows anonymous users to trigger mass deletion of markers via unsafe GET requests.",
