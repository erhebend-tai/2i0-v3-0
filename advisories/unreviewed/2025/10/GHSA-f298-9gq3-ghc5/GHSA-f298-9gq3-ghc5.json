  "details": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Bang Resto v1.0 could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's web pages. This vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding, allowing attacker-controlled input to be rendered directly in the browser. When exploited, an attacker can steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website. This can lead to user data compromise, loss of user trust, and a broader attack surface for more advanced exploitation techniques.",
