    "CVE-2025-11731"
  ],
  "details": "A flaw was found in the exsltFuncResultComp() function of libxslt, which handles EXSLT <func:result> elements during stylesheet parsing. Due to improper type handling, the function may treat an XML document node as a regular XML element node, resulting in a type confusion. This can cause unexpected memory reads and potential crashes. While difficult to exploit, the flaw could lead to application instability or denial of service.",
