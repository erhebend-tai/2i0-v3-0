  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: ftrace: Fixup panic by disabling preemption\n\nIn RISCV, we must use an AUIPC + JALR pair to encode an immediate,\nforming a jump that jumps to an address over 4K. This may cause errors\nif we want to enable kernel preemption and remove dependency from\npatching code with stop_machine(). For example, if a task was switched\nout on auipc. And, if we changed the ftrace function before it was\nswitched back, then it would jump to an address that has updated 11:0\nbits mixing with previous XLEN:12 part.\n\np: patched area performed by dynamic ftrace\nftrace_prologue:\np|      REG_S   ra, -SZREG(sp)\np|      auipc   ra, 0x? ------------> preempted\n\t\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t\tchange ftrace function\n\t\t\t\t\t...\np|      jalr    -?(ra) <------------- switched back\np|      REG_L   ra, -SZREG(sp)\nfunc:\n\txxx\n\tret",
