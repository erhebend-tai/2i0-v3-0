  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/9p: Fix buffer overflow in USB transport layer\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the USB 9pfs transport layer\nwhere inconsistent size validation between packet header parsing and\nactual data copying allows a malicious USB host to overflow heap buffers.\n\nThe issue occurs because:\n- usb9pfs_rx_header() validates only the declared size in packet header\n- usb9pfs_rx_complete() uses req->actual (actual received bytes) for\nmemcpy\n\nThis allows an attacker to craft packets with small declared size\n(bypassing validation) but large actual payload (triggering overflow\nin memcpy).\n\nAdd validation in usb9pfs_rx_complete() to ensure req->actual does not\nexceed the buffer capacity before copying data.",
