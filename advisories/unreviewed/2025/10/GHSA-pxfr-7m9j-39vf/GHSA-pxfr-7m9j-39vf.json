  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/netiucv: Fix return type of netiucv_tx()\n\nWith clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),\nindirect call targets are validated against the expected function\npointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate\nROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,\nwhich manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A\nproposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which\nreveals:\n\n  drivers/s390/net/netiucv.c:1854:21: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'netdev_tx_t (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' (aka 'enum netdev_tx (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)') with an expression of type 'int (struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]\n          .ndo_start_xmit         = netiucv_tx,\n                                    ^~~~~~~~~~\n\n->ndo_start_xmit() in 'struct net_device_ops' expects a return type of\n'netdev_tx_t', not 'int'. Adjust the return type of netiucv_tx() to\nmatch the prototype's to resolve the warning and potential CFI failure,\nshould s390 select ARCH_SUPPORTS_CFI_CLANG in the future.\n\nAdditionally, while in the area, remove a comment block that is no\nlonger relevant.",
