  "details": "TRUfusion Enterprise through 7.10.4.0 uses the /trufusionPortal/getCobrandingData endpoint to retrieve files. However, the application doesn't properly sanitize the input to this endpoint, ultimately allowing path traversal sequences to be included. This can be used to read any local server file that is accessible by the TRUfusion user and can also be used to leak cleartext passwords of TRUfusion Enterprise itself.",
