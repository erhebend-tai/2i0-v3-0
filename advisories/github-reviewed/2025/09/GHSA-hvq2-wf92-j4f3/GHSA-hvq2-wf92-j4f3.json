  "details": "# Security Advisory: express-xss-sanitizer\n\n## Overview\nA vulnerability was discovered in express-xss-sanitizer that allowed unbounded recursion depth during sanitization of nested objects.\n\n## Affected Versions\n- All versions prior to 2.0.1\n\n## Patched Versions\n- 2.0.1 and later\n\n## Description\nThe sanitize function in lib/sanitize.js performed recursive sanitization without depth limiting, making it vulnerable to stack overflow attacks via specially crafted deeply nested JSON objects.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker could cause denial-of-service by sending a request with deeply nested structures, potentially crashing the Node.js process.\n\n## Solution\nUpgrade to version 2.0.1 or later:\n\n```bash\nnpm install express-xss-sanitizer@latest\n```",
