  "summary": "node-cube vulnerable to prototype pollution",
  "details": "The node-cube package (prior to version 5.0.0) contains a vulnerability in its handling of prototype chain initialization, which could allow an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of built-in objects. This issue, categorized under CWE-1321, arises from improper validation of user-supplied input in the package's resource initialization process. Successful exploitation may lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution in affected environments. The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 5.0.0-beta.19, and no official fix has been released to date.",
