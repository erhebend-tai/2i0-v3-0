  "summary": "Indico may disclose unauthorized user details access via legacy API",
  "details": "### Impact\nA legacy API to retrieve user details could be misused to retrieve profile details of other users without having admin permissions due to a broken access check.\n\n### Patches\nYou should to update to [Indico 3.3.8](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.3.8) as soon as possible.\nSee [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is possible to restrict access to the affected API (e.g. in the webserver config) which is most likely unused anyway and thus will not break anything.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open a thread in [our forum](https://talk.getindico.io/)\n- Email us privately at [indico-team@cern.ch](mailto:indico-team@cern.ch)",
