  "summary": "WSO2's Input Validation Management Service contains Observable Discrepancy when Multi-Attribute Login is enabled",
  "details": "A username enumeration vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products when Multi-Attribute Login is enabled. In this configuration, the system returns a distinct \"User does not exist\" error message to the login form, regardless of the validate_username setting. This behavior allows malicious actors to determine which usernames exist in the system based on observable discrepancies in the application's responses.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability could aid in brute-force attacks, targeted phishing campaigns, or other social engineering techniques by confirming the validity of user identifiers within the system.\n\nThere is a fix available in version 7.8.491, however it has not been published to the Maven registry.",
