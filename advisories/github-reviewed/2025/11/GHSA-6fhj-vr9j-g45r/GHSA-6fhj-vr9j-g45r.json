  "summary": "CycloneDX Core (Java): BOM validation is vulnerable to XML External Entity injection ",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe XML [`Validator`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/validation/Validator.html) used by cyclonedx-core-java was not configured securely, making the library vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.\n\nThe fix for GHSA-683x-4444-jxh8 / CVE-2024-38374 has been incomplete in that it only fixed *parsing* of XML BOMs, but not *validation*.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in cyclonedx-core-java version 11.0.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf feasible, applications can reject XML documents before handing them to cyclonedx-core-java for validation.\nThis may be an option if incoming CycloneDX BOMs are known to be in JSON format.\n\n### References\n\n* The issue was introduced via https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/commit/162aa594f347b3f612fe0a45071693c3cd398ce9\n* The issue was fixed via https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java/pull/737\n* https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#schemafactory",
